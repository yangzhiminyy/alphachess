# C# for Cursor

A [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) extension that provides rich language support for C#. Powered by a Language Server Protocol (LSP) server, this extension integrates with open source components like [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) and [Razor](https://github.com/dotnet/razor) to provide rich type information and a faster, more reliable C# experience.

## Recommended Install

## How to use OmniSharp?
If you don’t want to take advantage of the great Language Server features, you can revert back to using OmniSharp by going to the Extension settings and setting `dotnet.server.useOmnisharp` to true. Next, uninstall or disable C# Dev Kit. Finally, restart Cursor for this to take effect.
